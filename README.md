# Dotfiles

Dotfiles to backup, restore, and sync my preferences and settings.

## How to use

Clone the repository in the $HOME folder:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/HofmannZ/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
```

Run the `install.sh` script list this:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

Next, sign into the App Store app and run:

```sh
./scripts/setup_mac_apps.sh
```

In VS code press `Command + Shift + P` and search for install `code` in path.

Next, you can configure some extensions:

```sh
./scripts/setup_editor.sh
```

Then, setup Keybase providing chained proof. Once setup, find the public PGP fingerprint by running:

```sh
keybase pgp list
```

(optional) Run the gpg setup script providing the PGP fingerprint:

```sh
./scripts/setup_gpg.sh 74432C545A2B88C97E7A02548EE0CAC87C95D82F
```

Yeah, thats my [public PGP fingerprint](https://keybase.io/hofmannz), check it out on Keybase.

That's it ðŸš€!

## Keep your system up to date

```

## Flutter setup

3. Launch Android studio.

## Trouble shooting

If you get the following question on startup:

```
Ignore insecure directories and files and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```

You shoud try to run:

```sh
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

In case gems are out of date:

```
sudo gem update --system -n /usr/local/bin && sudo gem update -n /usr/local/bin
```
